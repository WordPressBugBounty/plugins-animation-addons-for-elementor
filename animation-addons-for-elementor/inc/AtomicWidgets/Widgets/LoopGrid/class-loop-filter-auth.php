/**
 * Loop Filters — the authoriser.
 *
 * Visitor-driven filtering is the first time visitor input touches the Loop
 * Grid's query. This class is the gate: it turns "what the visitor sent" into
 * "what the saved page allows", and nothing else ever reaches build_query_args().
 *
 * The rule, in one line: THE VISITOR SENDS CHOICES. THE SAVED PAGE SAYS WHICH
 * CHOICES EXIST. A filter key is honoured only when a filter widget in the saved
 * `_elementor_data` targets this grid and declares that key; the value is then
 * resolved inside the widget's own declaration (a slug inside its taxonomy, a
 * value from its authored list, a sort key from its option list). Anything the
 * page does not declare is dropped silently — no error, because a stale shared
 * link must still open the page.
 *
 * Two inputs, one parser. The URL (`?aae_tax_area=gulshan,banani`) on the first
 * server render and the AJAX body (`filters={"aae_tax_area":"gulshan,banani"}`)
 * on a page change carry the SAME shape — a map of url_key => string — so the
 * authoriser has one code path and a rule added once holds on both.
 *
 * The output is a normalised `$filters` array handed to
 * Aaeaddon_A_Loop_Grid::build_query_args() as its own argument. It is deliberately
 * NOT smuggled through the settings blob: ajax_loop_post_data() (the editor
 * preview) passes client-sent settings straight into the builder, so a
 * `_filters` key there would let any `edit_posts` user hand-write a meta_query.
 *
 * WIDGET CONTRACT — the props the M2 filter widgets must expose. The authoriser
 * reads them off the saved element settings by these names:
 *
 *   common     target_grid (grid element id), url_key (default per type)
 *   tax        taxonomy, match ('any'|'all'), offer ('all'|'chosen'), terms
 *              (aae-query-chips JSON strings), include_children (bool)
 *   meta       source ('custom'|'acf'|'woo'), meta_key, mode ('range'|'choice'|
 *              'toggle'), value_type ('numeric'|'decimal'|'char'|'date'|
 *              'datetime'), min, max, choices (String_Array — "value" or
 *              "value|Label"), multi_stored (bool — serialized array, LIKE),
 *              toggle_compare ('exists'|'equals'), toggle_value,
 *              acf_field (ACF field key), woo_field ('price'|'rating'|'stock'|
 *              'onsale'|'featured')
 *   search     title_only (bool)
 *   author     offer ('all'|'chosen'), authors (aae-query-chips JSON strings)
 *   date       source ('publish'|'modified'|'meta'|'acf'), meta_key, acf_field,
 *              value_type ('ymd'|'date'|'datetime')
 *   sort       options (String_Array of JSON {key,label,orderby,order,meta_key,
 *              value_type})
