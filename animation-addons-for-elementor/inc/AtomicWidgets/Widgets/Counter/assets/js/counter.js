/* AAE Atomic Counter (single-class composite).
   - Start value + duration come from the parent's data-counter-* attrs
     (set by the panel's Start Number / Duration controls).
   - End value is read from the Number child's text content — whatever
     the user types into the Number element on canvas is the target.
     This makes the editable child the single source of truth for the
     end value and removes the panel-vs-child conflict.

   Deliberately GSAP-free (same approach as the Progressbar widget). The
   `gsap` handle is registered ONLY by the Pro plugin, and only when the
   `aaeaddon_save_extensions` option exists — so on a free site, or with the
   GSAP extensions toggled off, `window.gsap` is simply absent and the old
   implementation degraded to stamping the final number in with no
   animation at all. requestAnimationFrame always exists, so the counter
   now behaves identically everywhere.

   Scroll-in is driven by IntersectionObserver, NOT ScrollTrigger. The old
   `window.gsap.ScrollTrigger` guard could never be true — GSAP's UMD build
   exposes the plugin as `window.ScrollTrigger`, never as a property of the
   gsap object — so the tween always fired at page load and a counter below
   the fold had finished counting before the visitor ever scrolled to it. */

/**
 * The node that actually HOLDS the text, given an element or its editor wrapper.
 *
 * In the editor canvas every atomic child is mounted inside a wrapper
 *   <div class="elementor-element … elementor-widget-e-paragraph">
 * and the real node is the <span class="e-paragraph-base …"> inside it. That
 * span is what carries the base-style class AND the local style class the Style
 * tab writes — i.e. the font-family/size the builder picked. The frontend has no
 * wrapper at all; the span is a direct child of the counter.
 *
 * This matters because play()'s write() assigns textContent. Assigning it to the
 * WRAPPER deletes the styled span outright and leaves a bare text node behind,
 * so the number loses its font on every re-render — in the editor only, which is
 * exactly how the bug presented (verified in the v4 canvas: after a settings
 * change the wrapper's innerHTML went from
 * `<span class="e-paragraph-base …">50</span>` to plain `46`).

 * class lives in the child's `classes` prop, and the panel's "Some classes are
 * missing" notice can unapply it (its ✕ calls unapplyClasses on exactly those
 * ids), after which the lookup returns null on a perfectly healthy counter.
 * So the fallback has to be correct, not just a safety net — it picks the first
 * direct child whose text reads as a number (the Prefix child is empty and the
 * Suffix child is "+" by default), then resolves it to the real text node.
