/**
 * Aaeaddon_Rich_Text_Prop_Type — html-v3 that keeps inline COLOUR.
 *
 * Elementor's Html_V3_Prop_Type sanitises through
 * `Html_Prop_Type::get_base_allowed_tags()`, which permits **no attributes at
 * all** except `a[href|target]`. So `<span style="color:#c00">` is stripped on
 * save, and per-word colour is impossible no matter what the editor emits.
 *
 * This subclass swaps ONLY the sanitiser. It deliberately does NOT override
 * `get_key()`, so the stored `$$type` stays `html-v3` — which means:
 *
 *   • `htmlV3PropTypeUtil` on the client reads and writes it unchanged,
 *   • `Html_V3_Transformer` renders it unchanged,
 *   • no migration is needed, and swapping back to the stock prop type later
 *     costs nothing but the colours.
 *
 * Same trick the old AAE_Html_Rich_Prop_Type used against String_Prop_Type —
 * reuse the key, replace the whitelist.
 *
 * `class` is deliberately NOT allowed. It was the thing that leaked into the
 * Content box and cluttered the markup, and nothing in this widget needs it
 * now that colour is a real toolbar action.
 *
 * SECURITY — `style` is filtered, not trusted. wp_kses runs every style
 * attribute through `safecss_filter_attr()`, which whitelists CSS properties
 * and strips `expression()`, escapes and anything it does not recognise.
 * Event-handler attributes never survive (they are not on the list below), and
 * `href` / `src` go through kses' own protocol check, so `javascript:` is
 * neutralised.
 *
 * MEASURED, and NOT what an earlier revision of this comment claimed: WordPress
 * DOES allow `url()` for the background properties, so
 * `style="background:url(https://evil.example/x)"` survives. That is core's own
 * posture — identical to what it permits in post content — but it means a value
 * written here can reference an external URL. It is not script execution. If
 * that matters for a given site, filter `safe_style_css` / `safecss_filter_attr`
 * rather than assuming this layer stops it.
