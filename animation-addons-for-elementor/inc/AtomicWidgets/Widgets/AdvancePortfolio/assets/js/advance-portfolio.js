/**
 * AAE Advanced Portfolio — atomic (v4) frontend runtime.
 *
 * Build target: ../../../../../assets/atomic/js/advance-portfolio.js
 *
 * A direct port of animate_portfolio_content_three() from the Pro v3 bundle
 * (animation-addons-for-elementor-pro/src/js/advanced-portfolio-skins.js), kept
 * deliberately close to it: same `data-animation-settings` attribute, same JSON
 * keys, same ScrollTrigger start/end values, same pre-pose. `scrub` is the one
 * deliberate deviation — see SCRUB below. The v3
 * version is jQuery-based and hangs off `elementor/frontend/init` with a widget
 * scope; this one is a v4 frontend handler over the element root, so the only
 * real changes are the DOM lookups.
 *
 * What the animation is:
 *   - every `.item` starts pushed back and flat on its face
 *     (scale .5, opacity .7, perspective(4000px) rotateX(90deg) — the
 *     perspective via GSAP's `transformPerspective`, see below);
 *   - the `.section-title` is PINNED for the scroll span and scrubbed
 *     1 -> 3 -> 1 in scale, so the heading swells as the grid passes it;
 *   - each `.item` then rights itself on its own trigger as it comes up the
 *     viewport (scale 1, opacity 1, rotateX 0).
 *
 * GSAP and ScrollTrigger are Pro-only handles, declared as script_deps only
 * when the Pro plugin is active (see class-atomic.php). This file therefore
 * has to no-op cleanly without them rather than assume they exist — the free
 * plugin can be running on its own, in which case the portfolio still renders,
 * just without the scroll animation.

/**
 * How the tweens follow the scrollbar.
 *
 * `true` means "locked to scroll position": the tween's playhead IS the scroll
 * progress, so the frame on screen is the frame the scrollbar asks for and the
 * motion stops the instant the scroll stops.
 *
 * A NUMBER means a catch-up duration instead — the playhead eases toward the
 * scroll position over that many seconds, so the element keeps moving after the
 * visitor's hand is off the wheel. v3 used 2 for the cards and 1 for the
 * heading, and measured on the reference that is ~1.2s of motion continuing
 * against a completely frozen scrollbar. That is the "it animates by itself"
 * feel, and this is the single value that governs it.
 *
 * One constant for both triggers on purpose: with two different values the
 * heading and the cards drift apart from the scrollbar by different amounts,
 * which is what made the section feel loose rather than driven.

/**
 * Suppress Elementor's own transform transition on the given elements, and
 * return the undo.
 *
 * This is NOT cosmetic. Elementor core CSS gives every `.e-con` /
 * `.e-atomic-element` a `transform` transition of 0.4s with no user setting
 * involved, so a scrubbed GSAP tween gets a second, independent 0.4s ease
 * stacked on top of the one the scroll position dictates. The rendered
 * (on-screen) transform then trails the value GSAP wrote, and it keeps easing
 * for 0.4s after the visitor stops scrolling — the animation reads as
 * self-driven rather than scroll-tied.
 *
 * Measured on this page, sampling inline vs. computed rotateX while scrolling:
 *   with the transition     rendered trails by up to 3.27deg (avg 1.64deg)
 *   duration vars zeroed    gap is exactly 0.00deg
 * The v3 reference has no such transition at all — its `.item` is a bare
 * `<article class="item">` and computes `transition-duration: 0s` — which is
 * why the same GSAP code feels tight there and mushy here.
 *
 * Only the two duration vars are zeroed, never `transition` itself: the same
 * declaration also carries background / border / box-shadow, and those should
 * keep working. Doing it here rather than in the stylesheet also means an item
 * whose animation never runs (disabled, or below the breakpoint) keeps its
 * hover transform transition.

	// rotateX(90deg)'` alongside a `scale` — which the first version did,

	// output.
