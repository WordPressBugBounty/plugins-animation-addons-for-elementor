	 * into one cached file (`base-desktop.css`), ordered by element
	 * registration — and its own native elements (e-svg, e-heading, …)
	 * register after ours. So when one of our named base-style classes (e.g.
	 * Aaeaddon_A_Btn's `e-aae-a-btn-icon`, 30px) collides with a native default
	 * sharing the exact same selector shape (`.elementor .<class>`, hence the
	 * same specificity — e.g. `e-svg-base`'s 65px), the native rule lands
	 * LATER in that single file and wins the tie on the frontend, even though
	 * the builder recomputes styles live per request and shows the correct
	 * value. Confirmed on a real page: `aae-a-btn-css`'s <link> already prints
	 * BEFORE `base-desktop-css`'s in <head>, so a same-specificity override in
	 * our own stylesheet loses regardless of what it says.
	 *
	 * Deliberately NOT !important and NOT extra selector specificity — either
	 * would ALSO out-rank a future per-element LOCAL style override of the
	 * same property, since Elementor compiles every local override to the
	 * identical selector shape/specificity too. Depending on `base-desktop`
	 * only changes ORDER: Elementor always enqueues local per-element
	 * overrides even later than `base-desktop` (Atomic_Widget_Styles' 'local'
	 * style key registers at priority 30 vs Atomic_Widget_Base_Styles' 'base'
	 * key at priority 10, both on the same `elementor/atomic-widgets/styles/
	 * register` action), so a real customization still wins.
	 *
	 * Mirrors fix_preview_css_order() above: patch wp_styles()->registered
	 * deps directly at wp_print_styles (priority 0, the last safe moment
	 * before anything is echoed) rather than declaring the dependency at

	 *
	 * WHAT WAS REMOVED, AND WHY IT WAS SAFE. This method used to enqueue every
	 * active widget's ordinary `style_handle` too, and add the `editor-preview`
	 * dependency to each. Both halves were already being done, in the same
	 * request, by two other passes:

	 *     same `is_widget_active()` filter on `elementor/preview/enqueue_scripts`
	 *     and enqueues the same `style_handle` (its docblock says so).
	 *   - `fix_preview_css_order()` re-adds the `editor-preview` dependency to
	 *     every AAE handle — `editor_style_handle` included — at
	 *     `wp_print_styles` priority 0, which is the only pass that can also
	 *     reach Elementor's later-registered per-document CSS.

	 * two pages: the preview carried 26 AAE stylesheets with it and 25 without,
	 * with ZERO landing before `editor-preview` either way. The single missing
	 * sheet was the editor-only one — which is exactly what this method now
	 * owns, and nothing else changed. Editor-ready time was indistinguishable
	 * (within-state spread 2.3-4.6 s, larger than any gap between states, and
	 * the direction flipped between batches).
	 *
	 * So this is not a speed change — it removes duplicated work while keeping
	 * the one job no other pass can do.
	 *
	 * `add_style_dependency()` is still called here as belt-and-braces: it costs

	 * a suite covering seven cases against it would really cover the first one
	 * seven times.
	 *
	 * WP_DEBUG IS THE MASTER SWITCH. With it off this is a production site
	 * whatever else says, and nothing below is consulted. Worth knowing it
	 * outranks SCRIPT_DEBUG, which WordPress itself treats as independent — a
	 * site running SCRIPT_DEBUG on with WP_DEBUG off gets minified assets here.
	 * That is a deliberate local choice, not WordPress convention.
	 *
	 * Past that gate, any of these means dev:
	 *
	 *   - `wp_get_environment_type()` says `local` or `development` — WordPress's
	 *     own declared answer, set by whoever built the site, so it is asked
	 *     first. It defaults to `production` when nothing is set, which is why
	 *     `production` is NOT treated as authoritative: doing so would turn every
	 *     unconfigured local site into a production one.
	 *   - `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is on.
	 *   - The request host, or the site's own home_url() host, is loopback or a
	 *     development TLD.
	 *   - The server's own IP is loopback.
	 *
	 * THE PORT IS STRIPPED FIRST, and its absence was a real bug. `HTTP_HOST`
	 * carries `host:port`, so `localhost:8080`, `127.0.0.1:8000` and
	 * `mysite.local:8888` matched nothing and reported PRODUCTION — that is MAMP,
	 * `wp server`, Docker and Local's localhost router mode, all served minified
	 * assets and told their edits had not taken. Measured before the fix: 4 of 8
	 * real dev host shapes wrong.
	 *
	 * IPv6 loopback (`::1`) is included for the same reason — nginx and Apache
	 * both report it on a modern dual-stack box, and only `127.0.0.1` was tested.
	 *
	 * KNOWN LIMIT: `HTTP_HOST` comes from a request header, so a crafted
	 * `Host: something.local` can force dev mode on. It is still checked, because
	 * it is what catches a production database copied to a local machine, where
	 * home_url() still names the live domain. The cost of being wrong is bounded
	 * — unminified assets, a bypassed preset cache and an uncacheable asset
	 * version, for that one request, with no data exposed — so the detection is
	 * worth more than the hardening. Revisit that trade before widening what this
