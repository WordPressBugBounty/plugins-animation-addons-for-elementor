/**
 * Panel upsell cards for the Pro-owned atomic widgets.
 *
 * An atomic element type that nothing registers does not merely vanish from the
 * panel — Elementor DELETES it from `_elementor_data` on the next save. Free
 * used to ship transitional copies of the widgets that moved to Pro for exactly
 * that reason, retiring them through a version-gated stand-down. Those copies
 * and that machinery are both gone now, so on a free-only site every widget
 * below genuinely fails to register and earns its card.
 *
 * The list is the CANDIDATES; the REGISTRY decides. `missing_widgets()` asks
 * `Atomic::widget_code_present()` per slug, so a widget free still ships is
 * never advertised, and a widget added to Pro later starts advertising itself
 * the moment free stops shipping it — with no edit here.
 *
 * This is also why Counter and Nav are deliberately NOT listed: they came back
 * to free permanently and are not Pro-owned any more, so a card for either
 * would be an upsell for something the site already has.
 *
 * ELEMENTOR DOES ALL THE WORK; this class only supplies the data.
 * `elementor/editor/localize_settings` => `atomicWidgetPromotions`, and then:
 *
 *   - editor.js `initElementsCollection()` adds each entry's widgets to the
 *     panel collection with `editable: false` and our `promotionType`;
 *   - `editable: false` makes views/element.js `onRender()` return BEFORE it
 *     wires click-to-add and html5Draggable, which is what makes the card
 *     un-draggable, and makes the card template print a corner lock icon;
 *   - e-react-promotions.js `attachAtomicWidgetPromotionListeners()` registers
 *     a `<type>-promotion:open` listener that mounts the upgrade card carrying
 *     OUR title / content / ctaText / widgetCtaUrl.
 *
 * So there is no AAE JavaScript here at all, and none should be added: every
 * behaviour above is Elementor's own, which is the point — the cards behave
 * identically to a native Elementor Pro promotion, including the dialog's
 * placement, theme and RTL handling.
 *
 * VERIFIED against the installed Elementor 4.2.4, not just the source clone —
 * `atomicWidgetPromotions` is present in both `assets/js/editor.js` (the panel
 * half) and `assets/js/e-react-promotions.js` (the dialog half). If a future
 * Elementor drops the key the cards just stop appearing; nothing errors and no
 * real widget is affected, which is the right way for an upsell to fail.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — on a site that has Elementor Pro installed but NOT
 * connected, `applyProConnectPromotionOverrides()` (app-manager.js) replaces
 * the ctaUrl/ctaText of EVERY promotion card, ours included, with Elementor's
 * own "Connect & Activate" link. That is unconditional inside their app and
 * cannot be opted out of while we ride their card. The alternative is drawing
 * our own dialog, which costs a React surface in free and diverges from the
 * "just like Elementor's" behaviour this was asked to match.

	 * translated at all on such a site.
	 *
	 * The two lists drifting apart fails in only one direction, and it is the
