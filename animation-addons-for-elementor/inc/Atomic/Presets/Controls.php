/**
 * Injects a "Presets" section (the Apply Preset picker) into NATIVE atomic
 * widgets — e-heading, e-button, e-image, … — whose classes we don't own, so
 * the section can't be placed in define_atomic_controls() the way AAE widgets
 * do it (see AdvancedHeading).
 *
 * The section is only injected for native types explicitly listed in
 * ALLOWED_NATIVE_TYPES below. It used to be injected unconditionally for
 * every non-AAE element type (relying on the remote preset server to decide,
 * per element type, whether any presets existed) — that surfaced the
 * "Presets" section on widgets that were never meant to have it (e.g.
 * e-paragraph, e-image), because the remote catalog had entries for types no
 * one had actually opted into here. An explicit whitelist is the fix: add a
 * native type here only when you deliberately want it to offer presets.
 *
 * AAE's own widgets (e-aae-a-*) are always skipped here — they place their
 * own Presets section themselves in define_atomic_controls() (see
 * class-aae-a-btn.php, class-aae-a-btn-pro.php, class-aae-a-social-share.php,
 * etc.), so this whitelist never needs to (and must not) list an e-aae-a-*
 * type — doing so would add a second, duplicate "aae_presets" section
 * alongside the one the widget already builds itself.
