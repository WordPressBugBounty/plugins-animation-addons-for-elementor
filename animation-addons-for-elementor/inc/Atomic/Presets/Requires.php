/**
 * What a preset needs before it can work — and whether this site has it.
 *
 * A Loop Grid or Loop Filter preset is the first kind in this plugin whose
 * design is not self-contained. A property-directory filter set is wired to a
 * `property` post type and to ACF fields named `price` and `bedrooms`; a shop
 * filter is wired to WooCommerce's price index. Apply one of those on a site
 * that has none of it and every control renders, none of them filters, and
 * nothing anywhere says why. That is the failure this describes: not an error,
 * a design that silently does nothing.
 *
 * THIS CLASS ONLY ANSWERS. It installs nothing and writes nothing. Free can
 * honestly say what a preset needs and what is missing — `post_type_exists()`,
 * `is_plugin_active()` and ACF's own lookup are all free to ask — so the panel
 * can show the requirement whatever licence the site holds. Acting on it is a
 * separate question with a much higher bar, and it lives in Pro behind
 * `aaeaddon/preset/requires/install`; `installable()` reports whether anything is
 * listening, exactly as the starter template's dependency screen reports
 * `needs_pro` per row rather than offering a checkbox that would do nothing.
 *
 * DANGER — a `requires` block is UNTRUSTED INPUT. Most of them arrive from the
 * remote preset server, which means a compromised or mistaken server would
 * otherwise be naming plugins for this site to install. normalize() is the only
 * way one may be read: it whitelists the four keys, refuses a plugin slug that
 * is not a plain wordpress.org slug, refuses a plugin file that does not live
 * under that slug's own directory, and caps every list. The capability check
 * that decides whether an install may happen at all is Pro's, and is
 * deliberately NOT `edit_posts` — see that module.
