/**
 * AAE Forms — action interface (Milestone 7).
 *
 * The spec's action registry contract: every after-submit action (admin
 * email, auto reply, webhook, …) implements this one shape and runs through
 * the async Queue — never inline in the submit request. run() receives the
 * job's self-contained payload and reports success plus loggable snapshots;
 * the Queue owns attempts/retries/logging, actions own only their work.
 *
 * Register additional actions via the `aaeaddon_form/actions` filter (see
 * Registry).
 *
 * @package AnimationAddonsForElementor
 * @since   4.0.0
