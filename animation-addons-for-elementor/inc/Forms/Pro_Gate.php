/**
 * Licence gate for the Pro form fields and the multi-step feature.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT GATED, and why the difference matters more than the list:
 *
 *   - The element TYPE always registers, licensed or not. Elementor instantiates
 *     every element on save and DROPS any whose type is unregistered
 *     (get_elements_raw_data(), elementor/core/base/document.php:1111), so
 *     unregistering a Pro field would permanently delete it — and, for a
 *     container, everything inside it — from `_elementor_data` on the next save
 *     of any page using it. The gate therefore never touches registration.
 *   - What IS gated: the panel card stops being draggable, the frontend renders
 *     nothing, and the field leaves the submission schema.
 *
 * FOUR SEAMS, one list. Miss any of them and the failure is silent:
 *
 *   1. PANEL — Pro_Gated::is_editable() returns false while locked, which is all
 *      Elementor needs: views/element.js `onRender()` returns before it wires
 *      html5Draggable and click-to-add, the card template prints a lock icon,
 *      and mousedown opens the upgrade card. Verified that `editable` is read
 *      ONLY under regions/panel/pages/elements/ — an element already on the
 *      canvas (dropped by a preset, say) stays fully selectable and editable,
 *      which is exactly what we want: it must show a Pro notice, not become
 *      unreachable.
 *   2. FRONTEND — render_content returns ''. Leaf widgets only; see the note on
 *      Step below, which is a container and must NOT be blanked.
 *   3. SCHEMA + VALIDATOR — the important one, and the one nothing would remind
 *      you about. Schema_Walker builds the schema from the saved tree at save
 *      time, so a gated field stays in the schema even though the visitor never
 *      sees it. A REQUIRED gated field would then reject every submission with
 *      "this field is required" for a field that is not on the page. Conditional
 *      Display hit the identical problem first and left the seam behind
 *      (`aaeaddon_form/validator/skip_field`), so this reuses it.
 *   4. UPSELL COPY — our own title/body/CTA on Elementor's promotion card via
 *      `v4Promotions`, so a locked card sells this plugin rather than showing
 *      Elementor's generic Pro pitch.
 *
 * MULTI-STEP IS FLATTENED, NOT BLANKED — deliberately, and it is the one place
 * where "render nothing" would be the wrong reading of "make it Pro":
 *
 *   - `e-aae-a-form-step` is a CONTAINER. Blanking it takes every field inside
 *     it with it, so a lapsed customer's multi-step contact form renders as an
 *     empty box. That is not an upsell, it is a broken page that silently stops
 *     collecting leads.
 *   - Blanking only Next/Prev is worse still: the step base style is
 *     `display: none` until the runtime adds `aae-form-step-active`, so the
 *     visitor would be stranded on step one with no way forward.
 *
 *   So while locked the runtime reveals EVERY step at once (see
 *   assets/js/lib/multi-step.js, flattenSteps) and the nav widgets render
 *   nothing. The paid feature — stepping — is gone; the form still works and
 *   still converts. Step itself is in GATED_STRUCTURE for the panel and the
 *   editor notice, but is never passed to the render gate.
