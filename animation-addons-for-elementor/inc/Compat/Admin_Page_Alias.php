/**
 * The pre-4.2 admin page slugs, kept answering after the rename.
 *
 * `?page=wcf_addons_settings` is in bookmarks, in support articles, in the
 * shipped Pro (its licence screen redirects to it and its two submenu pages
 * register under `aaeaddon_page`), and in every theme that links to the
 * dashboard. A renamed slug that simply stopped resolving would answer all of
 * them with "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page" -- which reads as
 * a permissions problem, not a moved page.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, both WordPress's own:
 *
 *   1. A request for an OLD slug is redirected (301) to the new one with the
 *      rest of the query string intact, on `admin_menu` at priority 0.
 *
 *      NOT `admin_init`, which is where it shipped first (2026-09-17) and
 *      where it never fired: wp-admin/admin.php requires wp-admin/menu.php
 *      (line 163) BEFORE `do_action( 'admin_init' )` (line 180), and
 *      wp-admin/includes/menu.php ends in the `user_can_access_admin_page()`
 *      check that `wp_die()`s 403 for a `?page=` nobody registered. The old
 *      slug is exactly such a page, so every request for it died before the
 *      redirect had its turn -- measured over real HTTP, while a suite that
 *      fired `admin_init` by hand had reported it working. `admin_menu` is
 *      fired at the TOP of includes/menu.php, before the check.
 *
 *   2. `$_wp_real_parent_file[ old ] = new`, the alias table core keeps for
 *      `edit.php?post_type=post` -> `edit.php`. `add_submenu_page()` and
 *      `get_admin_page_parent()` both consult it, so a submenu an older Pro
 *      registers under the OLD parent lands under the real menu, with the
 *      hookname computed from the real parent -- its callback still fires and
 *      the menu still highlights.
