/**
 * The artwork carries the headline, the body copy, the illustration and the
 * earn chip, so all of that markup is gone — keeping a text copy underneath
 * would have meant two sources of wording to keep in step, and any drift
 * between them shows up as a mismatch on screen.
 *
 * What the artwork does NOT carry is the call to action, so the button is
 * overlaid. Offsets are percentages, not pixels, so it tracks the clear band
 * under the copy at every column width rather than drifting into it.
 *
 * The headline and copy are baked into the image, which makes them invisible
 * to a screen reader — hence the descriptive `alt`. It repeats the artwork's
 * own wording deliberately; that is the one place a second copy is correct.
