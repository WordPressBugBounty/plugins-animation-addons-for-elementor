/**
 * The hero, the 60% half of the top row.
 *
 * The artwork ships without a call to action, so the button is overlaid rather
 * than baked in — and it is the SAME GetProButton the header carries, so there
 * is no second hardcoded link to drift out of step with it.
 *
 * `upsellOnly` because this slot only ever sells Pro: it renders "Get Pro
 * Version" while Pro is absent from disk and nothing once it is installed.
 * The header keeps the full three-state control, so "Active Plugin" and
 * "Activate License" are still one click away on every screen.
 *
 * Offsets are percentages, not pixels, so the button tracks the clear area
 * under the feature list at every column width instead of drifting into it.
 *
 * NOTE: this no longer reads `WCF_ADDONS_ADMIN.hero`. That payload key is set
 * only when the Pro plugin is installed, and it points at
 * `assets/images/hero-banner.jpg` — the OLD artwork — so honouring it would
 * mean Pro users never see this banner. To restore that Pro/free swap, replace
 * that file with this art and put the branch back.
