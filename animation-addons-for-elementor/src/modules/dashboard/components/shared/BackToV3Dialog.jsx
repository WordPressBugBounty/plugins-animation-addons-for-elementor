/**
 * The permanent way back for a site that took the atomic offer.
 *
 * `AtomicUndoNotice` covers the accident noticed straight away, but it is
 * snapshot-based and therefore temporary: it ends when the user saves either
 * atomic list by hand, after seven days, and it never existed at all for anyone
 * who accepted before that snapshot was being taken. A return path that can
 * expire is not a return path — CLAUDE.md's Rule 6 is "always ship the manual
 * escape hatch", and this is it.
 *
 * THREE MODES, and the dialog says which one it is about to do, because they
 * do different amounts of work and the user is entitled to know:
 *
 *  - A snapshot is on file → **restore** it. Exact, down to option rows that
 *    had never existed.
 *  - No snapshot, widgets on → **switch off**. Both atomic options are written
 *    empty. Not an exact restore, and it does not claim to be; nothing is
 *    deleted, so it can never re-arm a migration behind the user's back (see
 *    `Atomic::ajax_atomic_optin_undo()`).
 *  - Nothing on at all → **hide the tab**. This is the "Choose manually" shape:
 *    the offer was accepted and no widget was ever enabled, so clearing the
 *    stored answer is the whole reversal and the server writes nothing.
 *
 * NOT STYLED AS A WARNING, unlike `DisableAllV3Dialog`. That one guards the
 * action that can blank a live page — an unregistered v3 widget renders
 * nothing. This one cannot: switching the atomic set off touches no v3 option,
 * and the V4 pages it does affect are the ones the user is telling us they
 * never meant to build on. Dressing it in red would borrow alarm it has not
 * earned, and the reassuring fact — that their V3 site was never modified — is
 * the main thing the dialog is here to say.
 *
 * @param {boolean}  open
 * @param {Function} setOpen
