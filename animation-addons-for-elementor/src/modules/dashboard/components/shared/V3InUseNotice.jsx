/**
 * One quiet line on the V4 widget list: this site's pages still use V3 widgets.
 *
 * Someone working entirely in the atomic list has no way to know that, and it
 * is the fact that makes the V3 switches dangerous — turning them off blanks
 * those pages (see DisableAllV3Dialog). Saying it once, where the person is
 * actually standing, is what turns that dialog from a surprise into a
 * confirmation of something they already knew.
 *
 * ONE LINE, LOW EMPHASIS — no card, no icon badge, no dismiss button. It is
 * context, not a task: nothing is wrong, nothing needs doing, and a notice
 * styled as an alert would say otherwise every time the page is opened.
 *
 * Renders nothing when no v3 content is detected (`V3_IN_USE`, from
 * `Animation_Settings::has_v3_usage()`), so a genuinely v4-only site never sees
 * a line about an era it does not use.
