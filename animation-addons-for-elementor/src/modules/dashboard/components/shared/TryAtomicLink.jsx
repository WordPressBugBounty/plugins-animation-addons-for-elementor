/**
 * "Try Elementor V4" — the way back IN, and the mirror of `BackToV3Link`.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Dismissing the opt-in notice is a one-way door without it.
 * The ✕ records a real answer (a dismissal that only hid the bar until the
 * next load would be a nag), so the notice never returns for that signal — and
 * with the V4 tab still hidden there is then no route into the atomic registry
 * at all short of typing `?system=atomic`. Somebody who says "not now" and
 * means it should not have to know a query string exists to change their mind.
 *
 * The asymmetry is what makes it worth shipping rather than merely nice: we
 * added a visible **Back to V3** and shipped no visible way forward, so the
 * feature read as easier to leave than to enter.
 *
 * WHEN IT SHOWS is `SHOW_TRY_ATOMIC_LINK`, and it is owned by
 * `lib/systemVisibility.js` rather than by this component — the Extensions page
 * needs the same answer to decide whether to render the tab ROW at all, and a
 * link that gated only itself was mounted inside a row that site never built.
 *
 * ONE CLICK, NO DIALOG — unlike `BackToV3Link`. That one asks first because it
 * WRITES: it can empty both atomic options, and the dialog exists to say which
 * of its three modes is about to run. This writes nothing but the stored answer
 * and switches nothing on, so there is nothing to warn about — and it is
 * reversible by the very link it reveals. Ceremony in front of a reversible,
 * non-destructive reveal reads as a warning the action has not earned.
 *
 * It records `accepted`, which is exactly what **Choose manually** records:
 * same outcome, same one line in the option, reached from the other direction.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY LOW EMPHASIS, matching Legacy (V3), Settings and Back to V3 —
 * 12px muted text, dotted underline, no button. Styled up it would re-advertise
 * an offer this person has already declined once, which is the definition of a
 * nag.
