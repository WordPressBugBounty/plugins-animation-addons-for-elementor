/**
 * "Usage" — runs the on-demand scan that counts the pages each widget is on.
 *
 * Sits on the tab row beside the Settings link, and is sized to belong there:
 * a compact outlined chip, not a full-height button. The emphasis is still a
 * step above its neighbours — it is a real action with a real cost (the scan
 * walks every `_elementor_data` row on the site) so it cannot read as a text
 * link — but it is not what anyone came to this screen to do, so it must not
 * compete with Enable All or Save either.
 *
 * SELF-CONTAINED on purpose, including its own upsell dialog: it is placed by
 * the page rather than by a top bar, so it cannot rely on a parent to own the
 * locked state.
 *
 * Locked without Pro (the scan lives in pro/inc/Usage/). The upsell is a PRO
 * badge on a live button rather than a disabled control — a control that looks
 * broken teaches nothing about why.
 *
 * @param {Function} onScan    Starts the scan.
 * @param {boolean}  scanning  Request in flight.
 * @param {boolean}  hasResult A scan has already completed this session.
