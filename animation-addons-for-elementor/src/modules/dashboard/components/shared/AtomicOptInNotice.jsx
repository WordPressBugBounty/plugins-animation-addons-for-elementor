/**
 * "This site is on Elementor V4 — Animation Addons has a set for that."
 *
 * THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. The dashboard hides the era a site does not use
 * (`lib/systemVisibility.js`), and it decides "does not use V4" from whether
 * anything atomic is switched on. That is right for a settled site and blind at
 * exactly the wrong moment: someone who has just turned Elementor's V4 on has
 * nothing atomic switched on yet — that is what arriving looks like — so the
 * tab that would introduce AAE's atomic registry is hidden from the one person
 * actively looking for it. This notice is the way in, and it is the ONLY new
 * route: nothing about the V3 lists, the V3 toggles or the existing visibility
 * rules changes, on this screen or any other.
 *
 * WHERE IT SHOWS. Above everything else on the Dashboard, Widgets and
 * Extensions screens. All three, deliberately: the Widgets and Extensions pages
 * are where somebody stands when they go looking for atomic widgets and cannot
 * find them, so a notice that only lived on the Dashboard would be missing from
 * the two screens where the question is actually being asked.
 *
 * WHEN IT SHOWS. `Atomic::atomic_optin_signal()` owns every condition (a V4
 * signal exists, nothing atomic is active yet, and the user has not already
 * answered at this signal strength). Do not add a second condition here.
 *
 * THE TWO SIGNALS ARE NOT THE SAME CLAIM, so they do not get the same sentence:
 *
 *   - `usage`      — V4 elements are saved in this site's pages. A fact about
 *                    their work, and the stronger reason to care.
 *   - `experiment` — Elementor's V4 switch is on. A fact about a setting.
 *
 * Saying the second while the first is true reads as though we had not looked.
 *
 * AND THEY CAN BOTH BE TRUE, which gets its own line rather than being collapsed
 * into the stronger one. "You switched V4 on and you are already building with
 * it" is a different, more specific observation than either half, and it is the
 * commonest case — someone turns the experiment on and then uses it.
 * ATOMIC_SIGNAL alone cannot express it: it carries only the strongest signal,
 * because that is what the ranked dismissal has to compare against.
 *
 * THE TWO BUTTONS.
 *
 *   - **Enable** writes the recommended set through the same endpoints the
 *     Widgets list saves through, then reloads onto the atomic list.
 *   - **Choose manually** enables NOTHING and only records the answer, which is
 *     enough to reveal the V4 tab (`ATOMIC_OPTED_IN`). It exists because
 *     "switch on ~100 widgets for me" is a reasonable thing to decline, and
 *     declining it should not also cost you the list.
 *
 * Both count as `accepted`: both mean this person asked to see the atomic
 * lists. Only the ✕ records a dismissal.
 *
 * NEITHER IS ONE-WAY. Enable takes a snapshot of the previous atomic state
 * first, and `AtomicUndoNotice` offers it back — a click that changes a hundred
 * things has to be reversible. Nothing v3 is read or written on this path at
 * all, so even before the undo, an accidental accept could not cost anyone
 * their existing site.
 */

/**
 * The opening sentence -- the whole reason the notice is on screen.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS THE POINT WHEN WE HAVE IT. "Pages on this site are built with
 * V4" is equally true of one abandoned test page and of a site that has moved
 * wholesale, and those two readers want opposite things from this notice. The
 * number is the entire difference, so it is stated rather than implied.
 *
 * A count of 0 means PHP DID NOT COUNT, not "none" -- it only pays for that
 * query when a notice is going on screen and the signal is usage -- so the
 * countless wording is kept as a real fallback rather than treated as dead
 * code. If it ever renders, it is still true.
 *
 * Each count variant is a WHOLE sentence through _n() rather than a noun
 * phrase interpolated into one. "%s pages ... are built" with a stitched-in
 * "1 page" reads as broken English in English and is unfixable in a language
 * whose verb agreement differs from ours -- the translator needs the sentence.
