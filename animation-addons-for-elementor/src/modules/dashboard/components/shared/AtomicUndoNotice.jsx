/**
 * The way back out of "Enable atomic features".
 *
 * That button switches on everything this site can register in one click. It is
 * the right shape for the offer — and precisely the shape somebody can press by
 * mistake, so it does not get to be one-way.
 *
 * WHAT "BACK" MEANS HERE. Not "switch everything off": the site had a STATE
 * before the click (usually no option rows at all, sometimes a half-built one
 * from an abandoned wizard run) and only restoring that exact state puts the
 * user where they were. PHP snapshots it before the first write and this
 * restores it, down to DELETING the rows that had never existed — an empty
 * `aaeaddon_atomic_extensions` is a different site from a missing one (see
 * `Atomic::UNDO_OPTION_NAME`).
 *
 * WHAT WAS NEVER AT RISK, and the notice says so. Accepting the offer does not
 * read or write a single v3 option, so an accidental accept never cost anyone
 * their V3 site — their widgets stayed registered and their pages kept
 * rendering throughout. Someone who has just realised they pressed the wrong
 * button is asking exactly that question, and the answer is reassuring, so it
 * belongs in the copy rather than in a docblock only we will read.
 *
 * WHEN IT SHOWS. `Atomic::atomic_undo_offer()` owns the rule — a snapshot is on
 * file and still inside its window. The offer ends by itself the moment the
 * user saves either atomic list by hand, because from then on the stored state
 * is their own work.
 *
 * The ✕ is not a "hide": it records **keep**, which is a real answer, and ends
 * the offer for good. A dismissal that only hid the bar until the next page
 * load would make it a nag.
