/**
 * Confirm before switching EVERY v3 widget or extension off.
 *
 * This is not an "are you sure?" for politeness. Turning the master switch off
 * unregisters the widgets, and **an unregistered widget renders nothing** — no
 * error, no notice, no placeholder, because Elementor emits not even a wrapper
 * for a widget type it does not know. A page built from them goes blank, and
 * nothing in the dashboard says why. It is the exact failure CLAUDE.md's DANGER
 * box is about, and the one case where the dashboard can destroy a live page's
 * output with one click.
 *
 * `maybe_enable_used_v3_widgets()` will NOT undo it either: that heals a site
 * whose option was never written, and an explicit all-off is a written choice.
 *
 * ── Why it is laid out this way ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version inverted its own emphasis: the frightening sentence ("pages
 * will render empty") was plain body text while the merely-contextual one sat
 * in a tinted box. They are now one callout, tinted danger, with the site's own
 * situation as its last and strongest line — a warning should look most like a
 * warning at the point it is most specific.
 *
 * Everything else is deliberately quiet so that callout carries the weight: the
 * count is a subtitle, the reassurance is a muted footnote, and the panel keeps
 * the badge/rounded/shadow idiom the rest of the dashboard already uses. The
 * only saturated things on screen are the alert badge and the confirm button.
 *
 * @param {boolean}  open        Dialog visibility.
 * @param {Function} setOpen     Visibility setter.
 * @param {Function} onConfirm   Applied only if the user goes ahead.
 * @param {string}   kind        'widgets' | 'extensions' — what is being disabled.
 * @param {number}   activeCount How many are on right now; makes the cost concrete.
