/**
 * Tabs that no longer have a screen and are answered by another one.
 *
 * Distinct from `performance` and `integrations` below: those screens MOVED
 * into Animation Settings as tabs and kept their own `case` here, so the old
 * URL still names something real. A retired tab has no screen left at all, so
 * pointing its URL at a replacement would leave the address bar describing a
 * page nobody can reach. It resolves and then rewrites itself instead —
 * MainLayout does the rewrite, this map is the single place that decides it.
 *
 * `free-pro` — the Free vs Pro comparison left the dashboard 2026-09-06 and
 * Settings took its sidebar slot. pages/FreePro.jsx and its ComparisonTable
 * are still on disk, just unrouted.
