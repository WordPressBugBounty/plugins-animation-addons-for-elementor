/**
 * Performance — how AAE's animation runtime is DELIVERED, as opposed to what it
 * does.
 *
 * This SCREEN is the free plugin's; everything behind it is Pro. The settings
 * store, the AJAX endpoints and the script-delivery pipeline all live in
 * paaeaddon/performance/dashboard_payloadoad reaches us through the
 * `aaeaddon/performance/dashboard_payload` filter Pro answers. Without Pro that
 * payload is an empty array, which is exactly how this page knows to render the
 * locked state rather than an empty one.
 *
 * Panels come from the server schema through the same generic FeaturePanel the
 * Animation Settings screen uses, so a field added to Performance::schema()
 * appears here with no JS change — and one TAB per group, built from the same
 * list, so a group added server-side gets its tab for free too.
 *
 * Tabbed rather than side by side: each panel now carries display conditions,
 * which are two selects wide and a row per rule, so four of them on one screen
 * is a wall of controls that has to be read to be understood. One at a time,
 * named in a strip at the top, is the same arrangement Animation Settings uses
 * and the reason the screen fits on a laptop again.
