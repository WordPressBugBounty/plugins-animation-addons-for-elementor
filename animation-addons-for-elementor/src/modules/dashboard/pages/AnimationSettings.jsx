/**
 * Animation Settings — the dashboard home for AAE's site-wide animation chrome.
 *
 * Most of these features previously lived only as Elementor Site Settings tabs
 * in the Pro plugin (v3, stored in the Kit). This screen is the v4 replacement
 * and writes to its own `aaeaddon_animation_settings` option; nothing here touches
 * the Kit. See inc/AnimationSettings/class-animation-settings.php for how the
 * two systems are kept from colliding.
 *
 * Smooth Scroll is the exception and came from somewhere else: its v3 form is
 * the Smooth Scroller EXTENSION, not a Site Settings tab. It leads the list
 * because it governs how the whole page moves, which is a bigger decision than
 * any of the individual pieces of chrome that follow it.
 *
 * Every panel is rendered by the generic FeaturePanel from the schema the
 * server ships, so there is no per-feature React here — adding a field to
 * Animation_Settings::schema() is enough. The left menu's order follows the
 * old Site Settings list users already know.
 *
 * Popup is the odd one out and has no panel here on purpose: it already has a
 * full v4 implementation of its own (the AAE Popup builder — a template type
 * with its own editor and settings modal), so duplicating a thin settings panel
 * for it would create a second, weaker place to configure the same feature.
