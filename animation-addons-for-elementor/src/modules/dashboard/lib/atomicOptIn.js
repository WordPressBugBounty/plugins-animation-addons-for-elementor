/**
 * The writes behind the atomic opt-in notice and its return path
 * (`components/shared/AtomicOptInNotice.jsx`, `AtomicUndoNotice.jsx`).
 *
 * The SELECTION is not new machinery: it comes from the same
 * `applyWizardSetup()` the setup wizard uses and the same `flatten*` helpers
 * the Widgets and Extensions lists save through, so "what a recommended setup
 * switches on" keeps living in exactly one place (`lib/setupPresets.js`)
 * instead of being restated in PHP.
 *
 * The REQUEST is one call, not three — see `Atomic::ajax_atomic_optin()`. The
 * enable has to take its undo snapshot and write both options inside a single
 * request, because the ordinary save endpoints deliberately END the undo offer
 * (a hand save is the user's own choice) and would delete the snapshot the
 * notice had just taken.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED: `aaeaddon_save_widgets` / `aaeaddon_save_extensions`,
 * the v3 pair. Not written, not cleared, not read. Switching the atomic set on
 * takes nothing away from a v3 site — its widgets stay registered, its pages
 * keep rendering, and its V3 tab is still on screen next to the new one. That
 * is also why the return path only has one option pair to restore. The wizard
 * has the same rule for a sharper reason (writing even an empty
 * `aaeaddon_save_widgets` disarms `maybe_enable_used_v3_widgets()` and can blank an
 * imported page); see the long comment in `components/wizards/WizFooter.jsx`.
