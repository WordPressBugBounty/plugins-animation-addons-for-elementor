/**
 * The client side of importing an Elementor V4 (atomic) starter template.
 *
 * Three things, and why each lives where it does:
 *
 *  - `ATOMIC_IMPORT_AVAILABLE` is a SNAPSHOT of the page payload, like every
 *    rule in systemVisibility.js: it decides whether a V4 card's Import button
 *    is offered at all, and that must not flicker mid-session. It is absent
 *    (→ false) whenever the atomic registry did not load — Elementor < 4, or
 *    the atomic experiment switched off — which is exactly when a V4 template
 *    would import and render nothing.
 *
 *  - `fetchAtomicImportStatus()` asks the server FRESH, at click time, because
 *    `in_use` changes during a session: the first V4 import makes every later
 *    one a "second import", and the dialog exists for that case. Reading it
 *    from the payload would show the warning one page load too late.
 *
 *  - `isV4Template()` is the one place the server's `builder_version` field is
 *    interpreted. Absent means V3 — the ~960 older templates carry no value.

/**
 * `is_animated` is the template server's "this demo carries AAE animations"
 * flag (an ACF true/false on both post types). It arrives as a real boolean,
 * and a template saved before the field existed arrives `false`, so only a
 * strict `true` earns the badge — never a truthy string.
