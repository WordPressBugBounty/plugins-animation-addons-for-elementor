/**
 * Which element system (Elementor V3 / V4 Atomic) this site is offered.
 *
 * A site that only ever uses one of the two should not be shown the other —
 * a new user landing on a V3 widget list has no idea what they are looking at,
 * and a long-time V3 user does not want an Atomic tab they will never open.
 * The dashboard therefore hides the system that is entirely switched off.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT, NOT LIVE STATE — deliberately. Every value here is derived once at
 * module load from the payload PHP shipped with the page (i.e. the SAVED
 * option), never from the reducer in app.context.jsx. Reading live state would
 * make the tab the user is standing on disappear the moment they toggled the
 * last widget off, mid-gesture and before they had saved anything. The new
 * layout appears on the next page load, which is when the saved state is
 * actually what these booleans claim it is.
 *
 * The hidden system is still REACHABLE by URL (`&system=v3` / `&system=atomic`)
 * — see resolveSystems() — so hiding is never a one-way door. Same arrangement
 * `performance` and `integrations` already have in showFullContent.jsx.
