/**
 * The client side of importing an Elementor V4 (atomic) starter page.
 *
 * Twin of src/modules/dashboard/lib/atomicImport.js — the two modules are
 * separate bundles by design, so this is a copy, not an import. Keep them in
 * step.
 *
 *  - `ATOMIC_IMPORT_AVAILABLE` is a SNAPSHOT of the page payload: it decides
 *    whether a V4 card's Import button is offered at all. Absent (→ false)
 *    whenever the atomic registry did not load, which is exactly when a V4
 *    page would import and render nothing.
 *
 *  - `fetchAtomicImportStatus()` asks the server FRESH at click time, because
 *    `in_use` changes during a session: the first V4 import makes every later
 *    one a "second import", and the dialog exists for that case.
 *
 *  - `isV4Template()` is the one place `builder_version` is interpreted.
 *    Absent means V3.
