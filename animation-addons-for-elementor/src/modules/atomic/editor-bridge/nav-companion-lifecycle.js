/**
 * Nav companion lifecycle — delete the Mobile Nav together with its Nav.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES. A Mobile Nav (`e-aae-a-mobile-nav`) is a SIBLING of the
 * Nav it belongs to, so Elementor does not cascade-delete it. There is already
 * an orphan sweep in NavItemsControl.jsx, but it lives inside
 * `MobileNavLifecycleControl` — a PANEL CONTROL, mounted only while that Nav is
 * selected. Deleting the Nav unmounts the control and tears down its
 * `setInterval`, so the sweep can never run for the Nav you just deleted. It
 * only fires later, when some OTHER Nav happens to be selected — which is why
 * the user had to hunt the companion down in the Structure panel.
 *
 * This module lives in the editor-bridge instead, so it is document-wide and
 * selection-independent. The panel-control sweep is deliberately left in place
 * as a second belt.
 *
 * WHY IT TRIGGERS ON `document/elements/delete` AND NOTHING ELSE — this is the
 * important part, not a detail. `removeElements()` registers its OWN undoable
 * history entry (editor-elements.js: `undoable({do, undo})` with
 * `useHistory: false` on the inner deletes). So deleting a Nav produces TWO
 * history steps: the Nav delete, then our companion sweep. Undo therefore
 * restores the companion FIRST — at which point its source Nav still does not
 * exist. A sweep that ran after *any* command (the obvious shape, and what
 * form-guards.js does for saves) would immediately re-delete it, and the user
 * could never undo their way back. Narrowing the trigger to the delete command
 * keeps undo working, because undo runs a history command, not a delete.
 *
 * Consequence worth knowing: getting a deleted Nav back takes TWO undos — first
 * the companion, then the Nav. That is inherent to `removeElements` owning its
 * own history entry, and it is recoverable, which the alternative was not.
