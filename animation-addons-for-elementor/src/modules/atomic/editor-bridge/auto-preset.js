/**
 * Auto-apply a default preset when a widget is freshly dropped.
 *
 * Some widgets drop unstyled: a bare Loop Grid Slider is a plain Post Image +
 * Post Title card, and a bare Image Compare is six children in normal flow
 * because all of its layout lives in its presets. To give a good out-of-the-box
 * result we apply a chosen default preset the first time such a widget is
 * created — the same transform the "Apply Preset" dropdown runs, so the outcome
 * is identical to picking that preset by hand.
 *
 * We hook Elementor's command bus (`document/elements/create`) rather than a DOM
 * observer: create fires once per drop with the new element in the model, and we
 * can locate the seeded slide item from the V1 container tree. We only act on the
 * user's own drop (not on undo/redo/import re-creates) and only once per element.

 *                   preset (the slider styles its slide item, not itself).
 *                   Omit it and the dropped widget receives the preset on
 *                   ITSELF — applyPresetModel replaces it in place.
 *   defaultChildren OPTIONAL freshness test: untouched only while the target
 *                   holds exactly these widget types and nothing else.
 *   defaultMarker   OPTIONAL freshness test: untouched only while EVERY child

 *                   when the preset seeds the SAME widget types as

 *                   re-apply to its own output forever (the replacement element
 *                   gets a fresh id, so `handled` never catches it).

 *                   be wrapped as { $$type: 'aae-rj', value: { desktop: <n> } }
 *                   — see applyAutoSettings. (An earlier attempt wrote a bare
