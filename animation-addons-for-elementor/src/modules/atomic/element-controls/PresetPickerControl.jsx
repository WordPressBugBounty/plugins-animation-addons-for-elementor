/**
 * PresetPickerControl — the "Presets" element-control for AAE atomic widgets.
 *
 * Registered into Elementor's shared controlsRegistry under the type id
 * 'aae-preset-picker' (see ./index.js) and rendered by the editing panel
 * wherever the PHP side places an Aaeaddon_A_Preset_Picker_Control.
 *
 * This is an ACTION control, not a prop-bound control: it carries no stored
 * value. A button opens a Dialog showing every preset for the selected
 * element's type as a branded card grid, grouped by category, each with a
 * larger thumbnail (or the placeholder image) and a PRO badge for premium
 * presets. Picking a card REPLACES the selected element in place with the
 * preset's design (settings + styles + children) via the shared
 * applyPresetModel() engine in preset-apply.js (the same engine
 * editor-bridge/auto-preset.js uses for the drag-drop default preset, so
 * both call sites stay in lock-step), then closes the dialog.
 *
 * Presets are fetched on demand (per element type, on mount) from this
 * plugin's own REST proxy — window.AAE_PRESET_CONFIG.restUrl (aae/v1/presets,
 * see inc/Atomic/Presets/Rest.php) — which merges remote (themecrowdy.com)
 * presets with any bundled local JSON server-side.
 *
 * Dialog/DialogTitle/DialogContent are the same @elementor/ui components
 * FormActionsControl.jsx already uses for its own element-control popup —
 * kept consistent with that existing convention rather than introducing a
 * different modal primitive. The accent color (#ff7a00) matches this
 * plugin's own established brand/upgrade color (see e.g.
 * inc/admin/row-actions.php's "Upgrade to Pro" link), not a new palette.
