 *
 *   ElementsCollection.model() resolves the class by `widgetType || elType`

 *   `this.config = elementor.config.elements[ this.get('elType') ]` — and
 *   `elType` is the literal string 'widget', which is NOT a key in
 *   config.elements. `this.config` is undefined, and because a converted leaf
 *   has `elements: []`, initialize() goes on to call onElementCreate() →
 *   getDefaultChildren() → `undefined.default_children` and throws. The
 *   element comes back null from createElements() and Elementor's own forEach
 *   then dies on `.model` of null — which is the error the user actually sees,
 *   two frames removed from anything that mentions the real problem.
 *
 * Real case: every AAE form preset on the preset server stores
 * `e-aae-a-form-submit` as a widget (18 nodes across all 16 presets); the
 * Submit button became a container so its label and icon could be real,
 * styleable elements. Regenerating the presets is the actual fix — this keeps
 * already-published ones working, here and on every site that has them.
 *
 * Deliberately GENERIC: it triggers on "this widgetType is a registered

/**
 * Cosmetic canvas fix for live-created atomic CONTAINERS (e-flexbox /
 * e-div-block / e-grid): the editor canvas does not stamp their `classes`
 * prop onto the preview node when they are created programmatically — the
 * class attribute only renders on a full document render. The saved model is
 * correct (frontend Twig renders the classes), but until a reload the preset
 * would look unstyled and marker-class CSS (hover overlays) would not match.
 * So after apply we mirror each created container's classes onto its preview
 * node. Widgets are skipped — their own markup already renders classes, and
 * duplicating e.g. a ::after marker onto the wrapper div would double the
 * effect.
 *
 * Retries a few times because the preview nodes mount asynchronously.
