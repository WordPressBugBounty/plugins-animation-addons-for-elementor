/**
 * The fixed palette every preset surface paints on.
 *
 * These are deliberately NOT the editor theme's `background.paper` / `text.*`
 * tokens. Those follow the editor's Dark/Light preference, and the preset
 * dialogs are full-bleed galleries of light-background thumbnails — on a dark
 * editor the sheet came out near-black while the artwork stayed white. So the
 * sheet is fixed and everything drawn on it takes its ink from here.
 *
 * It lives in its own module because there are now two dialogs (the picker and
 * the requirements sheet it opens) and a second copy of these values is how the
 * two would end up disagreeing about what white is.
 *
 * The one thing that does NOT use this palette is the trigger button in the
 * panel: that sits in the editor's own chrome and follows its theme, so its
 * disabled tint is expressed as a translucent wash instead (see
 * PresetPickerControl.jsx).
