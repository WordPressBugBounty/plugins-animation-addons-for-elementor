/**
 * "This design needs something your site doesn't have yet."
 *
 * A Loop Grid or Loop Filter preset is the first kind in this plugin whose
 * design is not self-contained: a property-directory filter set is wired to a
 * `property` post type and to ACF fields named `price` and `bedrooms`. Apply
 * one on a site with none of that and every control renders, none of them
 * filters, and nothing anywhere says why. This dialog is the "says why".
 *
 * IT NEVER BLOCKS THE APPLY. Every path out of it can still place the design —
 * a builder mocking up a layout they intend to wire up later is a perfectly
 * good reason to apply a preset whose data does not exist yet, and a picker
 * that refused would be overstating the problem (the design renders; it just
 * finds nothing). What the dialog owes the builder is the sentence they would
 * otherwise have to infer from an empty grid.
 *
 * WHO SEES A BUTTON is decided by the SERVER, twice over; this only paints it.
 * `canInstall` mirrors the endpoint's own `manage_options` check — NOT the
 * `edit_posts` that opens the picker — because a contributor who could make
 * this site install a plugin the remote preset server named would be remote
 * code execution by proxy. `installable` mirrors whether anything is listening
 * on `aaeaddon/preset/requires/install` at all, i.e. whether Pro is here. An editor
 * on a licensed site, and anyone on an unlicensed one, gets the requirement
 * line and no button — the same shape the starter template's dependency screen
 * already uses for a row it cannot satisfy.
