/**
 * AAE Inline Text — rich-text heading editing with a native colour picker.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT CORE'S EDITOR (read before "simplifying" it back).
 *
 * Core ships `InlineEditor` (TipTap) and we used it first. It cannot do colour,
 * and the reason is structural, not a missing option:
 *
 *   • ProseMirror schemas are IMMUTABLE after creation, so a colour mark cannot
 *     be registered onto the instance `onEditorCreate` hands us.
 *   • `InlineEditor` hardcodes its extension list (bold/italic/underline/
 *     strike/sup/sub/link/hard-break) with no prop to extend it.
 *   • Elementor exports no TipTap primitives — no `Mark`, no `useEditor` — so we
 *     cannot build a configured editor from its copy either.
 *   • Wrapping the DOM selection by hand does not stick: `getHTML()` serialises
 *     from the doc model, so an injected span is invisible to it and is wiped on
 *     the next keystroke. That also kills any class-based fallback — core's
 *     TipTap has no generic `span` mark, so even a bare `<span>` is unwrapped.
 *
 * The remaining options were "add TipTap as a dependency" or "own a
 * contenteditable". This is the second, chosen deliberately to avoid the
 * dependency.
 *
 * WHY THE OLD COLOUR BUG DOES NOT COME BACK. The previous attempt lived on the
 * CANVAS and drove `document.execCommand`, which only acts on the focused
 * editable — and the colour picker always holds focus while open. Two rounds of
 * fixes failed on that. Here:
 *   • formatting buttons `preventDefault()` on mousedown, so focus never leaves
 *     the editable and execCommand always has a target;
 *   • colour never uses execCommand at all. It wraps a saved Range directly,
 *     which needs no focus, and re-uses one span across the picker's repeated
 *     `input` events instead of nesting a new one per event.
 *
 * The value is still an html-v3 prop, so the panel keeps showing FORMATTED text
 * rather than tags — that was the original ask and it is unchanged.
 *
 * THREE LISTS MUST AGREE. ALLOWED_TAGS/ALLOWED_ATTRS here,
 * Aaeaddon_Rich_Text_Prop_Type::allowed_tags() in PHP, and the striptags whitelist in
 * aae-a-advanced-heading.html.twig. Anything this file emits but PHP omits is
 * deleted on save, which reads as "my formatting disappeared".

/**
 * Rewrite every `color: rgb(...)` / `rgba(...)` as `#rrggbb`, or `#rrggbbaa`
 * when the colour carries alpha.
 *
 * NOT cosmetic — without it colour silently disappears on save. WordPress's
 * `safecss_filter_attr()` strips only var()/calc()/min()/max()/minmax()/
 * clamp()/repeat() from the string it tests (`wp-includes/kses.php`), then
 * REFUSES any declaration still containing `(`. rgb()/rgba() are not on that
 * list, so the whole style attribute is dropped. And rgb() is unavoidable on
 * the client: the CSSOM serialises `style.color = '#c00000'` back out as
 * `rgb(192, 0, 0)`, so even assigning hex produces rgb() in innerHTML.
 *
 * Done on the STRING rather than via the DOM precisely because the DOM is what
 * re-introduces rgb(): any round-trip through a CSSStyleDeclaration undoes it.
 *
 * ALPHA IS PRESERVED, as the 8-digit form. That spelling is the whole reason
 * transparency is expressible here at all: it carries the alpha byte with NO
 * parentheses, so unlike rgba() it passes safecss_filter_attr() untouched and
 * needs no core filter relaxed and no site-wide security trade. It is CSS
 * Color 4, supported by every browser this editor runs in. An earlier revision
 * discarded alpha because `<input type="color">` cannot produce it — the
 * opacity control added alongside this now can.
