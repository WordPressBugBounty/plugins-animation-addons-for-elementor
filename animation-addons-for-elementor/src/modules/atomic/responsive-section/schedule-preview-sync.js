/**
 * Coalesce the preview push that follows a settings write into one per frame.
 *
 * The Elementor command in a cell's setValue() stays SYNCHRONOUS — it is the
 * model write, and undo/redo plus the saved document depend on every value
 * landing in order. Only the preview-side push is coalesced here: dragging a
 * slider calls setValue() per pointer move, and applySettingsToDom() rebuilds
 * the element's config and rebinds its GSAP tween on each one, so a fast drag
 * queues rebuilds faster than a frame can paint them.
 *
 * Keyed by caller so two different controls can never cancel each other, and
 * the LAST call booked before the frame always wins — dropping the trailing
 * call would leave the canvas showing the value before the one the user
 * released on.
 *
 * The callback re-resolves whatever it needs when it runs: a container held
 * across the frame can be stale if Elementor re-rendered the element in
 * between.
