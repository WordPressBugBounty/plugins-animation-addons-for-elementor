 * Elementor/MUI core, not this plugin. Until core fixes it, make removeChild /
 * insertBefore no-op instead of throwing when the node isn't actually parented

 * which renders one <ResponsiveRow> per (active-bp-visible) field.
 *
 * Adding a new section = one new extensions/<name>/config.js + one
 * import + one registerResponsiveSection() call below. The PHP side

 * Animation Addons — Atomic Editor Bridge (entry)
 *
 * Two responsibilities, each implemented in its own module under

 *
 *   1. Mirror atomic widget settings into preview-iframe DOM data-attrs
 *      live, as the user edits.            → settings-bridge + live-bridge
 *   2. Re-bind the runtime animation handler when elements re-render
 *      inside the iframe.                  → preview-pipe
 *
 * The "Play Now" button lives inside the responsive-section as a React
 * 'play-button' control — see responsive-section/inputs/PlayButtonInput.jsx.
 *
 * Adding a new widget/effect = add one entry to FEATURES in
 * `editor-bridge/features.js`. Everything else flows from that table.
 *
 * Cleanup-aware: every listener / observer / timer is tracked through the
 * disposables registry and torn down on document switch + beforeunload.

		//      element still needs its ScrollTrigger.
		//   2. `seen` — removed subtrees overlap, so the same element is reachable
		//      from several removed ancestors and would be reset repeatedly.
		//   3. `sweeping` — reset mutates the DOM, and a MutationObserver callback
		//      is a microtask: re-entering here never lets the queue drain.
