/**
 * Nav → the Dropdown Icon panel section.
 *
 * This is an ELEMENT section, not an extension: it attaches to an anchor prop
 * Aaeaddon_A_Nav declares in its own schema, so it appears on e-aae-a-nav only.
 * Same wiring as the WP Menu's panel — the responsive framework binds by
 * anchor key, never by element type, which is what lets it attach to an
 * Atomic_Element_Base the same way it attaches to a widget.
 *
 * Every row is a new responsive prop APPENDED to the existing Dropdown Icon
 * section. Nothing else on the Nav changes: the section keeps its Show Icon
 * switch and its Icon picker, in that order, and the three mobile icons keep
 * their pickers where they have always been (see fields.js for why they need
 * no rows of their own).
 *
 * Frontend/canvas delivery is CSS, not JS config:
 *   PHP  → Widgets/Nav/class-aae-a-nav-responsive.php  (footer <style>)
 *   JS   → editor-bridge/nav-responsive-preview.js     (same node, live)
