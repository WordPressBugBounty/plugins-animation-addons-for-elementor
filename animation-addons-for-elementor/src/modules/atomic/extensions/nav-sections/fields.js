/**
 * Nav — the one JS description of every dropdown-icon style row.
 *
 * Read by BOTH sides of the editor, which is the point of keeping it here:
 *   - config.js              builds the panel section from it
 *   - nav-responsive-preview builds the canvas <style> block from it
 *
 * MIRRORED in the Nav's `SECTIONS` table, which does the same job for the
 * frontend — and which lives in BOTH plugins:
 *   PRO  (live)     inc/AtomicV4/Widgets/Nav/class-aae-a-nav-responsive.php
 *   FREE (fallback) inc/AtomicWidgets/Widgets/Nav/class-aae-a-nav-responsive.php
 * `prefix` + `bind` + `sel` + `props` + `kind` must match those tables exactly.
 * Change one, change all three.
 *
 * WHY ONLY THE DESKTOP DROPDOWN ICON
 * ----------------------------------
 * The Nav injects four icons, and three of them — hamburger, close, back — are
 * real Atomic SVG children of the mobile companion, so they already have their
 * own Style tabs (select the icon in the Navigator: Width, Height and Color are
 * all there). They need no panel section here.
 *
 * The desktop dropdown indicator is the one that genuinely cannot be reached:
 * nav.js FETCHES the chosen SVG and inlines it into each has-dropdown label at
 * runtime (see injectDropdownIcons), so it is not a model, has no Style tab,
 * and nothing in the panel could size or colour it. That is what these rows fix.
 *
 * Unlike the WP Menu's table, rows here name a SELECTOR and a list of CSS
 * PROPERTIES rather than a single CSS variable: the injected icon has no
 * variable plumbing to re-set, so both builders emit complete declarations.
 * The reasoning is in the PHP file's docblock.
 *
 * `sel` is appended to the section's root selector — a leading space means "a
 * descendant of the root". `roots` picks which root: 'nav' is the Nav element
 * itself, which is where this icon lives.
 *
 * No `legacy` column, unlike the Menu's table: these rows are the FIRST way
 * this icon has ever been styleable, so there is no single-value prop for them
 * to inherit a display default from. Every row starts empty and emits nothing
 * until it is filled in.
